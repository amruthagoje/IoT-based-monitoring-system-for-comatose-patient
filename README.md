# IoT-based-monitoring-system-for-comatose-patient
IoT-based system for comatose patients using ESPwroom32 with sensors (DHT11, HW827, PIR, HC-SR04) to monitor vitals and movement. Data is displayed on an LCD and Blynk app. Aims to enable real-time, cost-effective healthcare monitoring and future smart hospital integration.

My project focuses on leveraging IoT technology to develop a cutting-edge monitoring system tailored for comatose patients. At its core, our system integrates an ESPwroom32 microcontroller with a suite of sensors including temperature/humidity, pulse, PIR, and ultrasonic sensors.

üîç Sensor Insights:
- Temperature & Humidity Sensor (DHT11): Utilizes NTC thermistor technology for accurate temperature measurement and employs a bidirectional single-wire interface for data transmission.
- Pulse Sensor (HW827): Leverages photoplethysmography (PPG) to measure heart rate, enabling precise monitoring of vital signs.
- PIR Sensor (HW416B): Detects patient movement through changes in infrared radiation, enhancing safety and alert systems.
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Estimates urine levels in the patient's bag by emitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.

‚öôÔ∏è System Operation:
The ESPwroom32 microcontroller serves as the central processing unit, collating data from sensors and executing programmed responses. Patient vitals and status updates are displayed both locally on a 20x4 LCD display and remotely via the Blynk IoT application dashboard.

üí° Impact & Future Scope:
Our IoT-based solution offers a cost-effective and adaptable means of patient monitoring, providing real-time insights crucial for medical intervention. Moving forward, we aim to enhance system capabilities and explore integration with broader healthcare networks.
